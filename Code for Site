Beef Classification = High Carbon Footprint
</h2>

<p> Beef has a higher carbon footprint compared to other foods. Here are the reasons why.</p> 
  </header>
    <ul> 
      <li> Industrial beef production system requires a lot of land, homes are cleared away and wildlife is killed to make this happen, even Indigenous land is wrongfully taken.</li>
      <li> The above is sometimes even with deliberate wildfires, which worsen deforestation. Cutting trees results in the release of CO2, accelerating climate change. </li>
      <li> Factory farms increase the chance of disease due to contact between humans and animals, and clearing wild habitats brings these animals closer to humans as well. This could cause another pandemic. </li>
      <li> Cows are famous for releasing an unparalled amount of Methane, a greenhouse gas which goes into the atmosphere. </li>
      <li> Forget the production of beef, with the amount of beef in demand, road pollution is at an all time high due to transportation services involved in manufacturing and distributing. </li>
    </ul>
